Starlight Community is a FiveM roleplay server that is ran by [DRZL](https://www.twitch.tv/ItsDRZL). The server contains numerous activities for criminals and civilians alike.

I have done the following for this server:
 - Created new resources to further the player's roleplay experiences.
 - Fixed up existing resources to streamline player experience.
