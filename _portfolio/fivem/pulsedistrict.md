This FiveM server I helped with their Alpha, Beta, and Beta 2.0 development process. I addressed bugs within the server alongside creating resources to enhance the experience of the server.

Due to the nature of the server, I won't be exposing publicly the technical details of the work I have done here. That is saved mainly for my open source projects.
