**Note:** This website is a work in progress. I may edit this post and a lot of other stuff to fit what I want. I just wanted to not have to pay another $100-ish just to host a website for 3 more months.

Man... GitHub Pages have come a long way since I really wanted to try and use them. Now, I can use it to host my website no issue (and it's cheaper for me too, big win)!

I would like to use this website a bit, but I wouldn't be shocked if this website gets stale pretty quick.
